# Example: User Registration

## User Story

**As a** user
**I want to** register an account with email and password
**So that** I can access the platform

## Additional Context

- Email must be in valid format (e.g., user@example.com)
- Password requirements:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - Must contain at least one number
  - Must contain at least one special character (!@#$%^&*)
  - Cannot be a common password (e.g., "password123")
- System should prevent duplicate email registrations
- Registration should create a user account in the database
- User should receive a confirmation email after successful registration

## Expected Test Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. Valid registration with correct email and password format
2. Registration creates user in database
3. Confirmation email is sent

### Edge Cases
1. Empty email field
2. Empty password field
3. Email without @ symbol
4. Email without domain
5. Password less than 8 characters
6. Password without numbers
7. Password without special characters
8. Extremely long email (>255 characters)
9. Extremely long password (>128 characters)

### Error Scenarios
1. Duplicate email registration attempt
2. Invalid email format
3. Weak password (common password)
4. SQL injection attempts in email/password
5. XSS attempts in email/password
6. Database connection failure
7. Email service unavailable

### Validation
1. Email format validation
2. Password strength validation
3. Input sanitization
4. Field length validation

### Security
1. Password should be hashed before storage
2. Prevent SQL injection
3. Prevent XSS attacks
4. Rate limiting on registration attempts
5. CSRF protection
